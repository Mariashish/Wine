# Wine Quality Analysis and Clustering

## Description:
This GitHub repository contains an analysis of wine quality based on a comprehensive dataset. The code, written in R, explores various aspects of the dataset, including descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and visualizations. The visualizations include 3D plots illustrating the presence of different acids, a health-related components plot, and a taste score boxplot.

The analysis extends to clustering techniques, utilizing methods like k-means clustering and mixture models. Variable selection is performed using clustering-based methods such as clustvarsel and vscc. The repository also includes the application of FlexMix, a flexible mixture modeling approach, for regression analysis.

Additionally, there is a Silhouette Analysis to determine an optimal number of clusters, providing insights into the structure of the dataset. The code is well-documented and organized, making it a valuable resource for anyone interested in exploring wine data, conducting clustering analyses, or implementing mixture models in R.
